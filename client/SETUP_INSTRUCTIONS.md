# 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

## ✅ **Current Status:**

- ✅ Frontend UI is complete and beautiful

## 🔧 **To Fix the RPC Errors:**

### 1. **Get Your Thirdweb Client ID** (Optional but recommended)
1. Go to [Thirdweb Portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/client)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your Client ID
4. Create `.env.local` file in `client` folder:
```bash
VITE_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
```

### 2. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**
Your contract needs to be deployed to Sepolia testnet at address: `0xcf13ec03df554cdf126e6e24b66a9ee46034dbf6`

**OR** update the contract address in `client/src/context/index.tsx` line 50.

### 3. **Get Test ETH** (for testing)
- Go to [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- Enter your address: `0xe446a520E9304F123F888209711b0cC03016cF69`
- Get test ETH for gas fees
